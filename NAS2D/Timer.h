	/**
	 * A timing class that provides high-resolution, millisecond-precision timing services.
	 *
	 * The Timer class provides elapsed time from the Timer start/initialization time.
	 *
	 * The reference start time can be moved forward relative by a specified number of ticks
	 * in case a new event needs to be measured relative to a previous event.
	 * This relative adjustment can be used to avoid issues with jitter,
	 * caused by the processing time for the old event before the new event is setup.
	 *
	 * \section Raw Tick
	 *
	 * A static method is provided for the raw time in ticks.
	 *
	 * With the current implementation, raw ticks are since app startup, and wrap back to 0 after about 49 days.
