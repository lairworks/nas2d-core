/**
 * \class	State
 * \brief	The State class operates within a StateManager as a separate unit of
 *			logic.
 * 
 * States make it easy to break certain parts of your program into separate and
 * distinct modes of operation. Using them is pretty straightforward although
 * there are a few requirements.
 * 
 * First and foremost, your custom state will derive from State. State has two
 * pure virtual functions that you need to override:
 * 
 * \code
 * void initialize() and
 * State* update
 * \endcode
 * 
 * \section state-init Initializing the State
 * 
 * After the State is constructed, the \c initialize() function is called. This only
 * happens once and is usually where event hooks are setup. Also, any GUI layouts
 * and other initialization that is inappapropriate to do in a constructor are done
 * in this function.
 * 
 * \section state-update State Updates
 * 
 * Updates to the State are done once every frame via the \c update() function. Updates
 * include logic, drawing, event handling, state changes, etc.
 *
 * \section state-template Base Template
 * 
 * The following is a template State object. Use this as a starting point for building
 * your own States. This is about as much boiler plate code as you'll need to start
 * a new State object:
 * 
 * \code
 * class MyState: public State
 * {
 * public:
 * 	MyState() {}
 * 	~MyState() {}
 * 
 * protected:
 * 
 * 	void initialize() {}
 * 	State* update() {}
 * 
 * private:
 * 
 * 	State* mReturnState;
 * };
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Note that the pointer to a State object as a member of the template class
 * is not required but recommended as a best practice for handling state switches.
 *
 * \note	The State class has twp functions ('initialize()', 'upate()') that all
 *			derived State objects must override.
