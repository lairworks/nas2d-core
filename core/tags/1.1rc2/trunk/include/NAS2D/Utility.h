/**
 * \class	Utility
 * \brief	A simple singleton type class used specifically for handling single
 *			instances of utility classes (like configuration, renderer, mixer, etc.)
 *			where only one instance should only ever be created for an application.
 *
 * This is a very basic implementation of the single pattern used for getting references
 * to single instance classes like Renderer, Mixer, Configuration, Filesystem, etc.
 *
 * \warning	This class is \a not thread safe. All utilities must be instantiated
 *			from the main thread of any application that uses them.
 *
 * \note	\c Utility offers only basic exception safety. If an exception occurs
 *			during instantiation of its internal type the exception will not be
 *			caught. In general practice using any of the core utility classes, an
 *			exception being thrown indicates a serious error that must be
 *			address by the client.
 *
 * \warning	\c Utility offers a static member method \c Utility::clean(). This
 *			should \a only \a ever be used when nothing is using the instance of
 *			T (e.g., at the end of a program.)

	 *
	 * \warning	This function is only intended to be used in very special
	 *			cases where the caller needs to instantiate an object that
	 *			derives from type T.
