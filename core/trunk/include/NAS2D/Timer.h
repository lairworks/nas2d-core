/**
 * \class Timer
 * \brief A timing class that provides high-resolution, millisecond-precision timing services.
 * 
 * The Timer class provides three different method for getting and managing timing.
 * 
 * \section Raw Tick
 * 
 * By far the simplest method, raw ticks provide the current tick in milliseconds since the application
 * started. You can get this value by calling the function <tt>unsigned int tick() const</tt>.
 * 
 * As a note, according to SDL documentation, values will roll back over to 0 if the application runs
 * for more than 49 days. In practice this should cause no noticable side effects (as all values are
 * in <tt>unsigned int</tt>'s).
 * 
 * \section Delta Change
 * 
 * This is a basic method of getting delta times, or the difference in time from the last time <tt>delta()</tt>
 * was called to the current call.
 * 
 * This is the simplest timing method in that physics simulations can use a raw delta value like this
 * to determine how far to advance the simulation, etc.
 * 
 * \section Accumulators
 * 
 * The third and final method for handling timing is through the use of an Accumulator. In essence, an accumulator
 * is just what it sounds like. It accumulates the elapsed time every time it is updated. The accumulator will continue
 * to report the current accumulated time in milliseconds since the Timer was created or since the last call to
 * <tt>void reset()</tt>.
 * 
 * Additionally, the accumulator provides a method to adjust the accumulated time. Calling <tt>void adjust_accumulator(unsigned int a)</tt>
 * will adjust the accumulated time counter by the amount indicated by \c 'a'. E.g., a positive value will adjust the
 * accumulator forward vs. a negative value which will adjust it backward.
 * 
 * Using accumulators are very useful when it comes to timing things like animation accurately to account for
 * jumps and gaps in time, for instance if the application stalls for a few seconds.
 * 
 * Accumulators are used internally in the Sprite animation handling to account for time desynchs between frames. As
 * time passes the frame counter loses accuracy. Using an accumulator corrects for these inaccuracies by skipping
 * frames whenever needed.
