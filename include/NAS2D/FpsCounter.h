 * \class FpsCounter

 *
 * FPS values are only approximates. As the FPS count gets higher, the returned value
 * becomes a more average count.
 *
 * \note	Because of the nature of FPS counters and their limited context, the
 *			FpsCounter has been designed with shared state. This means that multiple
 *			instances of FpsCounter will share values.
