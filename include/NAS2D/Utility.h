/**
 * \class	Utility
 * \brief	Provides a simple interface to classes that should only be instantiated
 *			once globally for a NAS2D application.
 *
 * \c Utility is a simple templated class designed to provide easy access to 'global'
 * objects that should only ever be instantiated once (for instance the Renderer,
 * Filesystem and Mixer classes).
 *
 * Most often usage cases are a simple matter of asking for a reference to a specific
 * type that is used several times within a section of code. For instance, if you
 * wanted to get a reference to a Renderer:
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Keep a reference to use multiple times in a code block.
 * Renderer& r Utility<Renderer>::get();
 *
 * r.drawBox(0, 0, 10, 10, 255, 255, 255, 255);
 * r.drawLine( 10, 10, 400, 200, 255, 0, 0, 255, 4);
 * // and so on
 * \endcode
 *
 * If you only need to use the reference for one or two calls, it may make more
 * sense to just use the provided reference:
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * // Only need to make a single call.
 * Utility<Mixer>::get().stopAllAudio();
 * \endcode
 *
 * \sa <a href="https://github.com/lairworks/nas2d-core/wiki/Using-Derived-Types-with-Utility">Using Utility<T> with Derived Types</a>
 *
 * \note	\c Utility does not catch exceptions. If any instantiated object
 *			throws the client will be responsible for handling it.
